Kubernetes is a critical platform for executing any application using containers and is also a core technology for cloud-native solutions. The CKA certification is among the most respected certifications in the Kubernetes ecosystem. In this course, solutions architect and Microsoft MPV Rodrigo Díaz Concha guides you through each of the topics that is included on the exam. Learn about storage classes, persistent volumes, reclaim policies, and configuring applications with persistent storage. Discover troubleshooting techniques, including how to evaluate cluster and node logging, monitor applications, and troubleshoot application failure, cluster component failure, and networking. Explore workloads and scheduling, then dive into cluster architecture, installation, and configuration. Plus, go over connectivity between Pods, service types and endpoints, and Ingress controllers and resources.
